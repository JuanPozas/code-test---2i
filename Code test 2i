# In a language of your choice, using all best practice principles you're aware of, 
# could you please provide code that 
# iterates in multiples of A until X, 
# then in multiples of A + 1 until 2X, 
# then multiples of A + 2 until 3X. 

# Please state any assumptions you've made.

# What are Mutiples:
# Multiples are really just extended times tables.
# The multiples of 2 are all the numbers in the 2 times table, such as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and so on.
#Ã‚ Multiples of 2 always end with a 2, 4, 6, 8 or 0. You can tell 2286, for example, is a multiple of 2 because it ends with a 6.
# The multiples of 5 are all the numbers in the 5 times table, such as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and so on.
# Multiples of 5 always end with a 5 or a 0. You can tell 465, for example, is a multiple of 5 because it ends with a 5.
